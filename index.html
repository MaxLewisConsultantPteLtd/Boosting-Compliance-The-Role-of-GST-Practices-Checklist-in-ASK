                    <p>In Singapore, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) plays a pivotal role in the countryâ€™s tax landscape, significantly contributing to government revenue. To foster compliance and simplify processes for businesses, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has introduced the GST Assisted Self-help Kit (ASK). This initiative assists businesses in better understanding and fulfilling their GST obligations. A key tool within ASK is the Pre-Filing Checklist, designed to enhance compliance and streamline the reporting process.</p>
